These instructions are intended for a tournament organizer. In theory, you're reading this because
you've just extracted a zip file submitted to a tournament. If that's not your situation, go look at README.md
instead.

1. Install Java 8 or newer.
2. Reference the included `.cfg` file as you would do with a plain python bot.
3. Before running the match, double click on the `.bat` file included in
this submission. It should stay open and manage the java bot.


You only need to run a single instance of the `.bat`, and it can handle all the bots in this zip
in the whole match, even on opposite teams.


Advanced:

- It's fine to close and restart `.bat` while the framework is active.
- If there is a port conflict, you can modify the port in the bot's python file.
to use a different one. There's one here and one in the bin folder.

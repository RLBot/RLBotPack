[Details]
developer = Eastvillage
description = Rocket League SideSwipe is Psyonix' mobile port of Rocket League. This script will emulate SideSwipe by forcing all players and the ball onto the YZ-plane. It is recommended to use the mutator 'Boost Amount: Recharge (fast)' due to the lack of boost pads in the middle. Kickoff positions are deterministic and assumes left-goes protocol. Supports up to 5v5.
fun_fact = Actually better than the real SideSwipe

# Short description of the bot
description = PenguinBot is based on the
	principle that strategy is more important
	than skill in Rocket League. PenguinBot
	aims to try to make perfect rotations, and
	trys to keep a player attacking the ball at
	all times.

# Fun fact about the bot
fun_fact = The first mode that this bot was coded
	to play was Dropshot. In Alpha stages it was
	able to convincingly beat ReliefBot in this
	gamemode. Due to lack of testing, _DaCoolOne_
	refuses to comment on whether PenguinBot still
	can achieve this feat.

class Kickoff(Maneuver):
    """
    Base class for kickoffs. Every kickoff maneuver should inherit from this. Usually kickoffs are made
    out of multiple phases (for example drive - dodge - drive - dodge). This class can help with that.
    Just write your phase logic in your step function, set the 'self.action' attribute and call super().step().
    If you don't want that, just override step() normally.

## Rocket League

Rocket League is a game that's avalible for PC (Windows only), Xbox, PS and Switch.
Many people say that it's "car soccer" but it actually has more in common with ice hockey.

### RLBot

RLBot is a framework that allows programmers to run their code to control a custom-made bot.

### I CALL HAX

RLBot is offically supported by Psyonix, and it had it's own custom API made for it.
When running RLBot, you can't play online. Only offline. There's no way to get around this.

Offline play is 100% functional, and there have been several RLBot competitions held.
Some of these are offical, and some are unoffical.

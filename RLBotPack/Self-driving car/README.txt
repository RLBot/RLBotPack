This bot is part of the RLBot bot pack. The easiest way to get a copy is to open
the RLBot GUI and download the bot pack from there. Then drag "Self-Driving Car"
onto a team and click Play!

If you're using a different match runner, as long as it is compatible with RLBot
config files, you can use the config named `self-driving-car.cfg` inside the
`self-driving-car` directory.

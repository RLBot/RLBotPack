[Details]
developer = Eastvillage
description = Tron game mode. Every car will leave a trail behind. By default, the ball and human players can collide with the trail (this among other things can be changed in settings.py). The script is not optimized and can be laggy with 3+ players. Debug rendering must be ON when using this script.

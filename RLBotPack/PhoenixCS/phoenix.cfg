# Short description of the bot
description = Phoenix, reincarnated with RedUtils! Phoenix is a 1v1 bot with great mechanics (thanks to CodeRed) and positional awareness. When making Phoenix I try to leverage the recent advances in the RLBot community. 

# Fun fact about the bot
fun_fact = The phoenix bird symbolizes immortality, resurrection, and life after death. In ancient Greek and Egyptian mythology, it is associated with the sun god. According to the Greeks, the bird lives in Arabia, near a cool well. Every morning at dawn, the sun god would stop his chariot to listen to the bird sing a beautiful song while it bathed in the well.
